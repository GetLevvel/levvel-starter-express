### TL;DR

An opinionated express boilerplate. Includes Cors, Helmet, Compression, and Morgan

## Key Libraries

### Cors

This project uses a library called [Cors](https://github.com/expressjs/cors) for providing a Connect/Express middleware that can be used to enable CORS with various options.

### Helmet

Using [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

[Compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) is a library to make requests lighter and load faster, responsible for compacting the JSON responses and also the static files which your application will serve via GZIP format; a compatible format to several browsers.

### Morgan

[Morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) is a middleware for generating requestâ€™s logs in the server.
